[To-do list]

Preprocessing: 

  * polyMeshConversion -> fvMesh constructor

  * Specifying the destination time directory for reading/writing polyMesh

Postprocessing:

  * Support for pointFields

  * Selection of fields to be read in

  * Extracting fields within a given timestep range (or a single timestep)
    -> only the startTime can be specified now

  * volVectorField -> cell-center pointVectorField conversion (for
    data size reduction)

  * Polyhedra decomposer
